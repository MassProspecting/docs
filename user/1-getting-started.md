After you signed up, you will be asked to create your first **sub-account**.

## 2. Setup Your Sub-Account

Sub-accounts are a great way keep your campaigns divided and isolated.

- If you are an Agency, create one sub-account for each client you have.

- If you are a Company, create one sub-account for each sector in your organization.

You can create a new sub-account [here](https://massprospecting.com/subaccounts/new).

In the picture above, you are creating a **free** sub-account.

- You can create no more than one free sub-accounts.

- Any more sub-account must be assigned to an active **subscription** to any of [MassProspecting plans](https://massprospecting.com/plans).

- A subscription cannot be assigned to more than one sub-account. 

After you have created your subaccount, you will be redirected to the **marketplace**.

## 3. Connect Apollo, Reoon and GMail

In order to start your outreach campaing in a matter of minutes, MassProspecting provides you with a **marketplace** of other people's profiles that you can use for a monthly fee.
