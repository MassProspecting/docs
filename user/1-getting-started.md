After you signed up, you will be asked to create your first **sub-account**.

## 2. Setup Your Sub-Account

Sub-accounts are a great way keep your campaigns divided and isolated.

- If you are an Agency, create one sub-account for each client you have.

- If you are a Company, create one sub-account for each sector in your organization.

You can create a new sub-account [here](https://massprospecting.com/subaccounts/new).

- You can create no more than one free sub-accounts.

- Any more sub-account must be assigned to an active **subscription** to any of [MassProspecting plans](https://massprospecting.com/plans).
