# Getting Started

## Abstract

Welcome to MassProspecting! This platform integrates tools to create powerful prospecting workflows.  

MassProspecting is not just a multichannel outreach tool. It lets you connect with leads on LinkedIn, Facebook, and via email. You can scrape leads, analyze their behavior, and use AI to send tailored messages.  

But that’s not all. You can integrate third-party tools like Apollo for lead enrichment or Reoon for email verification. With these integrations, MassProspecting acts more like an advanced integration tool, similar to Zapier.  

This tutorial will guide you through the first steps to master MassProspecting.
