# Leasing Profiles

In order to start your outreach campaing in a matter of minutes, MassProspecting provides you with a **marketplace** of other people's profiles that you can use for a monthly fee.

You can find the marketplace [here](https://massprospecting.com/marketplace).

In the marketplace you can find:

1. social profiles like LinkedIn or Facebook that you can use for scraping leads or sending outreach either;

2. LTDs (_life-time deals_) for email verifiers like Reoon and ZeroBounce;

3. pre-warmed email accounts like GMail and GSuite; and

4. leads data source like Apollo.

If you still want to connect your own profiles, MassPropsecting allows you to connect them, as it is explained [here](/docs/user/3-registering-your-profiles.md).
