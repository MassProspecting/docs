# Scraping Leads

If you don't want to [import your leads](/user/4-import-leads.md), but scraping leads instead, you can setup a new **source** into one of your [sub-accounts](/user/1-getting-started.md#2-setup-your-sub-account).

So you have to access a sub-account first:

1. Login to your MassProspecting account [here](https://massprospecting.com/login).

2. In the left-bar, click on **subaccounts**.

3. Click on the sub-account where you want to add your profiles.

Once in your sub-account:

1. In the left-bar, click on **sources**.

2. In the top-bar, click on the **plus button**.

You will be redirected to the **new source** screen, from where you can:

Choose one of the available sources (e.g.: **LinkedIn Public Feed**),

and define:

1. a descriptive name for your new source (E.g.: `architects promoting a new project`); and

2. one or more URLs to run the search (E.g.: [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?authorIndustry=%5B%2248%22%5D&keywords=%22new%20project%22&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&sid=r-1&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?authorIndustry=%5B%2248%22%5D&keywords=%22new%20project%22&origin=FACETED_SEARCH&sid=r-1&sortBy=%22date_posted%22
)).
