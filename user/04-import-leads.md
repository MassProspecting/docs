# Import Leads

If you already have a list of leads, you can easily import them into one of your MassProspecting [sub-accounts](/user/1-getting-started.md#2-setup-your-sub-account). Follow the steps below to complete the import process.

## Accessing a Sub-Account

1. Login to your MassProspecting account [here](https://massprospecting.com/login).
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Subaccounts**.
3. Select the sub-account where you want to add your leads.

## Starting the Import Process

1. In the sub-account, click on **Leads** in the left sidebar.
2. In the top menu, click on the **Upload button**.

You will be redirected to the **New Import** screen, where you can:
- Upload your list in CSV format, or
- Copy and paste the list content.

## Step 2: Advanced Import Settings

Configure the advanced options for your CSV file:
- Specify if the **first row** is a header and should be skipped.
- Define the **field separator** (e.g., comma, tab, etc.).
- Set the **enclosure character** (also known as the quoting character) for fields.

**Note:** You can use the `auto` option to let MassProspecting detect your CSV format. However, for best results, itâ€™s safer to manually configure these settings.

## Step 3: Content Submission

In the **Content Section**:
- Select the file you want to upload, or
- Copy and paste the content of your list directly into the provided field.

Click on the **Upload button** to proceed.

On the mapping screen:
- Match each field in your CSV to a corresponding field in the MassProspecting database.
- Once the mapping is complete, click on the **Import button** to finalize the process.
