# Import Leads

If you already have a list of leads, you can import them into one of your MassProspecting [sub-accounts](/user/1-getting-started.md#2-setup-your-sub-account).

So you have to access a sub-account first:

1. Login to your MassProspecting account [here](https://massprospecting.com/login).

2. In the left-bar, click on **subaccounts**.

3. Click on the sub-account where you want to add your profiles.

Once in your sub-account:

1. In the left-bar, click on **leads**.

2. In the top-bar, click on the **upload button**.

You will be redirected to the **new impoort** screen, from where you can:

1. upload your list in CSV format; or

2. copy and paste such a list.

The step-by-step of a list importing is described in the sections below:

## 1. Basic Import Settings

- You have to assign a descriptive name to the import.
- You have to assign a tag to all the leads imported.
- You can use an existing tag, or create a new one.

## 2. Advanced Import Settings

At the advaced configuration, you can define the formst of the CSV content, like:

- if the **first row** is a header and you want to skip it in the import process,

- what is the **field separator**; and

- what is the **enclosure char** (a.k.a. quoting char) for the fields.

For the field separator option you can choose `auto` and MassPropsecting will try to detect your CSV format automatically. With that said, it is always safer if you define exactly the format of your CSV file. 

## 3. Content Submission

In the **content section**, 

- choose the file you want to upload; or 

- copy and paste its conent.

Then click on the **upload button**.

You will be redirected to the **mapping screen**.

## 4. Fields Mapping

Assign each field in your CSV to one field in the MassPRospecting database.

Then clock on the **import button**.
