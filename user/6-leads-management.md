# Leads Management

After you [import your leads](/user/4-import-leads.md) or you [scrape leads](/user/5-scraping-leads.md), you can manage them in the **leads screen**.

You have to access a sub-account first:

1. Login to your MassProspecting account [here](https://massprospecting.com/login).

2. In the left-bar, click on **subaccounts**.

3. Click on the sub-account where you want to add your profiles.

Once in your sub-account, in the left-bar, click on **leads**.
