# Registering Your Profiles

If you want to connect your own profiles instead of [leasing them](/user/2-leasing-profiles.md), MassPropsecting allows you to do that, as it is explained in this article.

Profiles are added into one of your  [sub-accounts](/user/1-getting-started.md#2-setup-your-sub-account). So you have to access a sub-account first:

1. Login to your MassProspecting account [here](https://massprospecting.com/login).

2. In the left-bar, click on **subaccounts**.

3. Click on the sub-account where you want to add your profiles.

Once in your sub-account:

1. In the left-bar, click on **integrations**.

2. Click on the plus button.

You will be redirected to the integrations screen, from where you can connect your profiles of LinkedIn, Facebook, Apollo, Reoon, etc.

There are 2 types of integrations:

1. Native Integrations, and
2. Profile Integrations.

## 1. Native Integrations

A **native integration** is the ability to connect MassPropsecting to a third-party service like [OpenAI](https://openai.com) or [Zyte](https://zyte.com).

Native integrations are not used to perform any operation, but they are used by **Profile Integrations**.

## 2. Profile Integrations 

A **profile integration** is a **social account** like LinkedIn or Facebook; or a **SaaS accounts** like Apollo, Reoon, FindyMail, ZeroBounce, Targetron, etc.

Profile integrations are used for **scraping**, **enrichment** and **outreach** operations. 

Unlike native integrations; profile integrations are **open source**, and any **software developer** can create new profile integrations using our [MassProspecting SDK](https://github.com/massprospecting/mass-sdk) and [MassProspecting API](https://github.com/massprospecting/mass-client).

There are 4 types of profiles integrations:

1. **basic** access,
2. **API** access,
3. **MTA** access; and
4. **RPA** access.

## 3. Basic Access

Basic profiles manage public pages, and they don't require login credentials or api keys.

Basic profiles usally uses the native integration to perform their operations.

**E.g.:** Our [Indeed](https://indeed.com) integration will require your [Zyte](https://zyte.com) API key to scrape Indeed pages.
