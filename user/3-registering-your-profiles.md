# Registering Your Profiles

If you want to connect your own profiles instead of [leasing them](/docs/user/2-leasing-profiles.md), MassPropsecting allows you to do that, as it is explained in this article.

Profiles are added into one of your  [sub-accounts](/docs/user/1-getting-started.md#2-setup-your-sub-account). So you have to access a sub-account first:

1. Login to your MassProspecting account [here](https://massprospecting.com/login).

2. In the left-bar, click on **subaccounts**.

3. Click on the sub-account where you want to add your profiles.

Once in your sub-account:

1. In the left-bar, click on **integrations**.

2. Click on the plus button to integrate a new profile.

You will be redirected to the integrations screen, from where you can connect your profiles of LinkedIn, Facebook, Apollo, Reoon, etc.
