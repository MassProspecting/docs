# Leads Management

After you [import your leads](/user/4-import-leads.md) or you [scrape leads](/user/5-scraping-leads.md), you can manage them in the **leads screen**.

The Leads Management Screen allows users to view, filter, and manage leads efficiently. This interface is designed to display detailed information about each lead, apply filters to refine search results, and perform bulk actions on selected leads.
