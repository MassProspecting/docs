# Case Study 8: Bulk Tags Removing Using Rules

So I messed up...

When I access to the [imports screen](/user/04-import-leads.md) of my [subaccount](/user/01-getting-started.md#2-setup-your-sub-account) I see I imported 268 leads, but assigned to the tag `cold-apollo` instad of `group members`.

In short, I chosen the wrong tag when I submited my CSV file.

So, followed the steps below to fix my mistake:

1. I imported the same CSV again, but this time I assigned the right tag.

2. I configured a new [rule](/user/15-rules.md) called `Remove tag 'test-apollo' from leads with tag 'group members`, and it looks like follow:

| Name                     | Remove tag 'test-apollo' from leads with tag 'group members' |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apply to Previous Events | `true`                                                       |
| Delay                    | N/A                                                          |
| Trigger name             | `"When a lead is tagged as 'Group members'"`                 |
| Trigger type             | `:tag_added`                                                 |
| Trigger parameter.tag    | `:'Group members'`                                           |

| Action name              | `"Remove the tag 'cold-apollo'"`                             |
| Action type              | `:remove_tag`                                                |
| Action parameter.tag     | `:'Cold-apollo`                                              |
